## Approach

I implemented the dashboard dynamically by integrating an API to fetch data instead of using static JSON. The fetched data is passed to components like MetricCard, SalesChart, and TopSellingItems, ensuring real-time updates. I also handled loading states and errors to improve the user experience. Additionally, I implemented filters for selecting dates or months, allowing the dashboard to display data dynamically based on user input.


## Tools and Frameworks Used

- **Programming Language**: Javascript.
- **Frameworks**: React.js, TailwindCSS.
- **Tools**: Git for version control,Render(Fro Deployment).

## Challenges Faced

Rendering the data dynamically was a bit challenging as it involved integrating APIs and ensuring proper state management for seamless updates. Additionally, working with charts for the first time, especially combining multiple datasets like supplier and customer records in the SalesChart and customizing the PieChart, required some effort to understand and implement effectively.
